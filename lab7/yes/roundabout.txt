Roundabout 	

I'll be the round about
The words will make you out 'n' out
You change the day  your way
Call it morning driving thru the sound and
In and out the valley

The music dance and sing
They make the children really ring
I spend the day your way
Call it morning driving thru the sound and
In and out the valley

CHORUS
In and around  the lake
Mountains come out of the sky and they
Stand there
One mile over we'll be there and we'll see
You
Ten true summers we'll be there and
Laughing too
Twenty four before my love you'll see I'll be
There with you

I will remember you
Your silhouette will charge the view
Of distance atmosphere
Call it morning driving thru the sound and
Even in the valley

CHORUS

Along the drifting cloud the eagle searching
Down on the land
Catching the swirling wind the sailor sees
The rim of the land
The eagle's dancing wings create as weather
Spins out of hand
Go closer hold the land feel partly no more
Than grains of sand
We stand to lose all time a thousand answers
By in our hand
Nex to your deeper fears we stand
Surrounded by a million years

I'll be the roundabout
The words will make you out 'n' out
I'll be the roundabout
The words will make you out 'n' out

CHORUS

I'll be the roundabout
The words will make you out 'n' out
I spend the day your way
Call it morning driving thru the sound and
In and out the valley
