Cord Of Life

A man conceived a moment's answers to the dream,
Staying the flowers daily, sensing all the themes.
As a foundation left to create the spiral aim,
A movement regained and regarded both the same,
All complete in the sight of seeds of life

Changed only for a sight of sound, the space agreed.
Between the picture of time behind the face of need,
Coming quickly to terms of all expression laid,
Emotion revealed as the ocean maid,
All complete in the sight of seeds of life with you.
Oh.

Turn round tailor,Coins and
Assaulting all the mornings of theCrosses
Interest shown,Never know
Presenting one another to the cord,Their fruitless worth;
All left dying, rediscoveredCords are broken,
Of the door that turned round,Locked inside
To close the cover, the mother earth.
All the interest shown,They won't
To turn one another, to the sign Hide, hold, they won't
At the time Tell you, watching the world,
To float your climb. Watching all of the world,
Watching us go by.

And you and I climb over the sea to the valley,
And you and I reached out for reasons to call.
