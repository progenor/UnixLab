Wanderous Stories 	

I awoke this morning
love laid me down by a river.
Drifting I turned on upstream
Bound for my forgiver.
In the giving of my eyes to see your face.
Sound did silence me
leaving no trace.
I beg to leave, to hear your wonderous stories.
Beg to hear your wonderous stories.

He spoke of lands not far
or lands they were in his mind.
Of fusion captured high
where reason captured his time.
In no time at all he took me to the gate.
In haste I quickly checked the time.
if I was late I had to leave to hear your wonderous stories.
Had to hear your wonderous stories.

Hearing
Hearing
Hearing your wonderous stories.
Hearing your wonderous stories.
It is no lie I can see deeply into the future.
Imagine everything
You're close
and were you there to stand
so cautiously at first and then so high.
As he spoke my spirit climbed into the sky.
I bid it to return
to hear your wonderous stories.
Return to hear your wonderous stories.

Hearing,
Hearing,
Hearing,
Hearing,
Hearing,

Going For The One 	

Get the idea cross around the track
underneath the flank of thoroughbred racing chasers.
Getting the feel as a river flows.
Would youlike to go 'n shoot the mountain masses?
And here you stand no taller than the grass sees.
And should you really chase so hard.
The truth of sport plays rings around you.

Going for the one
Going for the one

Get in the way as the tons of water
racing with you crashing thru the rudder.
Once at the start you can gamble
that you really surely really mean to finish.
After seeing all your sense of fear diminish.
As you treat danger a pure collection.
As you throw away misconceptions.
Going for the one.
Going for the one.
Going for a

taken so high
to touch to move
listen to life

taken so high.
Roundabout, sounding out, love you so
love you so
love you so

Now the verses I've sang
don't add much weight to the story in my head
so I'm thinking I should go and write a punch line.
But they're so hard to find
in my cosmic mind
so I think I'll take a look out of the window.
When I think about you
I don't feel low.
N'should I really chase so hard.
The truth of sport plays rings around you.
Going for the one.
Going for the one.
Going for to

Moments decide.
Moments delight.
Moments in flight.
Talk about sending love.
